# Time Series Data Simulation with Multiprocessing
A simulation using **multiprocessing** (with Python) to generate 10,000 time dependent samples from an initial dataset of 20 samples.  
  
**Tasks** accomplished:  
(1) Defined function to calculate rate of change of time series data  
(2) Applied above function on time series data files  
(3) Simulated new values of rates using Pool's starmap function  
(4) Defined function to simulate parameter values  
(5) Initialized variables to start parallel simulation  
(6) Initiated and tracked simulation using 2 parallel processes  
(7) Created final dataframe containing time column
